  <strong>Consolidation</strong>
  <br> <br>
  With liberalisation of Indian economy by the Government of India, our country is flooded with direct foreign
  investment and arrival of multinationals for business promotional activities. Two way trade is therefore increasingly
  made mandatory.
  <br> <br>
  Import cargo coming into India both by air and sea can be imported with cheaper freight rate under the concept of
  Import Consolidation.
